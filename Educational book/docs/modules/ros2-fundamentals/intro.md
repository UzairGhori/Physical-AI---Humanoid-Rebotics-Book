# ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Module Overview

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware framework for robotics development. Students will learn the foundational concepts of ROS 2 for controlling and interacting with physical robotics systems, including understanding nodes, topics, services, actions, and custom messages.

ROS 2 represents the second generation of the Robot Operating System, designed with production environments in mind. Unlike ROS 1, ROS 2 is built on DDS (Data Distribution Service) for communication, providing better real-time performance, multi-robot support, and security features essential for modern robotics applications.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Install and configure ROS 2 on their development environment
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes
- Implement publisher/subscriber communication patterns
- Design and use custom messages and services
- Utilize ROS 2 tools for debugging and system introspection
- Control a simple simulated robot via ROS 2 commands

# API Contracts for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

This directory contains API contracts for the educational content management system. Since this is primarily a documentation project, the "APIs" represent interfaces for:

1. Content delivery system
2. Simulation environment integration
3. Assessment and grading system
4. Student progress tracking

These are conceptual interfaces that would be relevant if the course content was delivered through an interactive platform rather than static documentation.

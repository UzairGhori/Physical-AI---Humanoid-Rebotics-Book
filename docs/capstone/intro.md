# Capstone Project - Embodied Intelligence System

## Project Overview

The capstone project integrates knowledge from all modules (ROS 2, Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA) to design, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive embodied intelligence system. Students will create a functional system that addresses a predefined challenge in physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this capstone project, students will be able to:
- Synthesize knowledge from all course modules into a cohesive system
- Design an embodied intelligence system architecture
- Implement and integrate multiple technologies (ROS 2, simulation, AI)
- Evaluate system performance and document findings
- Present technical solutions effectively

# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive course on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This course covers advanced robotics concepts including ROS 2, simulation environments, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action models for embodied intelligence.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four core modules designed to provide you with comprehensive knowledge and practical skills in modern robotics:

### [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./modules/ros2-fundamentals/intro)
Learn the foundational concepts of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), including nodes, topics, services, actions, custom messages, and launch files. This module covers the latest ROS 2 distributions including Jazzy Jalisco and best practices for modern robotics development.

### [Simulation Environments](./modules/simulation/intro)
Explore robot simulation environments such as Gazebo and Unity for designing, testing, and iterating on robotics algorithms.

### [NVIDIA Isaac Robotics](./modules/nvidia-isaac/intro)
Leverage NVIDIA Isaac Sim and the Omniverse platform for high-fidelity simulation, AI model training, and deployment for complex robotics applications.

### [Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models](./modules/vla-integration/intro)
Implement Vision-Language-Action models that bridge perception, natural language understanding, and robotic control for intelligent humanoid robot behaviors.

### [Capstone Project](./capstone/intro)
Integrate knowledge from all modules to design, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive embodied intelligence system.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics:

1. Start with the [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./modules/ros2-fundamentals/intro) module
2. Progress through each module sequentially for optimal learning
3. Complete the hands-on labs and assessments
4. Work on the capstone project to integrate all concepts

Each module includes theoretical content, practical labs, and assessments to ensure comprehensive understanding and practical application of the concepts.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (C++ or Python)
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Basic knowledge of Linux/Unix systems (recommended)
